== Auto Tweet for ExpressionEngine

Allows you to set up automated tweeting of entries, based on a schedule.

== Requirements

* The the oAuth PECL extension (http://pecl.php.net/oauth)
* PHP >= 5.2

== Installation

To install this module fully, you need to take the following steps. *If you already have a consumer key and consumer secret from Twitter, skip to step 2.*

1) Register your website with Twitter (http://twitter.com/oauth_clients/new), setting "Application Type" set to "Client" and "Default Access Type" set to "Read & Write". The rest of the details are up to you.

2) Add the "Consumer Key" and "Consumer Secret" you received from Twitter to your EE configuration file:

# Twitter oAuth config
$conf['twitter_oauth_consumer_key'] = 'myconsumerkey';
$conf['twitter_oauth_consumer_secret'] = 'myconsumersecret';

3) To automate the process, create a new template whose contents are a single tag (or use the provided one):

{exp:auto_tweet:cron}

4) Set up a cron job to ping that URL every hour. For example:

* */1 * * * wget -q -O /dev/null http://my-site.com/cron/auto_tweet

== Notes

Upon installing, the Module will walk you through all of this before allowing you to set it up.
